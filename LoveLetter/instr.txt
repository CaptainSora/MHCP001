__Welcome to *Love Letter*!__

As a suitor to the princess, you are competing to have your love letters delivered to the Princess
The objective of the game is to win the most favor tokens by successfully delivering your letter.

On your turn, you draw a card and then choose one of your two cards to play.
Play then proceeds with the player below you.

Rounds can be won by either:
    - Eliminating all other players; or
    - Having the highest number card once the deck runs out.

The winner of each round obtains 1 token.
If there is only one player who plays or discards a spy, they also gain 1 token.

The game is won when at least one player has enough favor tokens to win:

Players: 2 3 4 5 6
Tokens:  6 5 4 3 3
