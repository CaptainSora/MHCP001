            - Whoever first attacks it gets it
        - Battle mechanic
            - RPSLS-style
            - Stab/thrust beats slash, weakly beats guard
            - Slash beats guard, weakly beats counter
            - Guard beats counter, weakly beats parry
            - Counter beats parry, weakly beats stab/thrust
            - Parry beats stab/thrust, weakly beats slash
            - Different monsters can have different usage rates and resistances
                to certain attack types
            - Beats = 2x, weakly beats = 1.5x
                - Need to consider exact interactions
                - I.e. defensive moves do damage only if successful?
                - Consider: beats = 1.5/0, weakly beats = 1/0
                    - neither = 1/1 or 0/0 depending on attacking/defending
            - Other ideas:
                - Charge doubles(?) next move damage, attacks cancel it
                - Heal restores hp, can be stopped by attacks and counter?
                    - Consumes item?
                - Generalized defensive item
                    - Can be stopped by attacking moves

                - Generalized offensive item
                    - Can be stopped by defensive moves
                    - Successful otherwise
                    - Perhaps cancels offensive moves?

            - If runs out of HP, has a cooldown period before starting healing
                - Otherwise starts healing immediately
                - Alternatively, only heals if put into hospital
                    - Cannot be taken out until fully healed?
                    - 0 hp = automatic hospitalization?
                    - Or heals v slowly outside of hospital
                    - Hospital has limited spots, upgradable?
