        - Battle mechanic
            - RPSLS-style
            - Stab/thrust beats slash, weakly beats guard
            - Slash beats guard, weakly beats counter
            - Guard beats counter, weakly beats parry
            - Counter beats parry, weakly beats stab/thrust
            - Parry beats stab/thrust, weakly beats slash
            - Different monsters can have different usage rates and resistances
                to certain attack types
            - Beats = 2x, weakly beats = 1.5x
                - Need to consider exact interactions
                - I.e. defensive moves do damage only if successful?
                - Consider: beats = 1.5/0, weakly beats = 1/0, neither = 1/1
            - Other ideas:
                - Charge doubles(?) next move damage, attacks cancel it
                - Heal restores hp, can be stopped by attacks and counter?
                    - Consumes item?
                -
