Long ago, when the world was young, only the legendary Pokémon existed. Mew had been given the power of Life, and began to make from itself the lower Pokémon, but Mew worried that the Pokémon would have difficulties surviving on the young planet, and therefore asked that for every Pokémon that it created, one of the legendary Pokémon named itself as its Guardian and would watch over the species for ever and ever.

The legendary Pokémon had previously divided the year between themselves such that each ruled over one week in one of the four seasons of Water, Earth, Fire and Air. Mew, however, asked that they dedicate the individual days of their reigns to the mortal Pokémon. The legendary Pokémon agreed to it, and when Mew created a family of Pokémon, one of the legendaries would name itself as the Guardian of that family and dedicate to it one of its days.

But though all agreed to this system, the legendary Pokémon still had conflicts of their own. In particular, when a mysterious Pokémon calling itself Deoxys had arrived from outer space and demanded a place among the legendaries, some opposition had remained despite the vote coming down in its favor.

One day, on the Day of Magikarp, the legendary Pokémon arranged a great gathering to discuss the state of the world, but many did not want Deoxys to attend, still suspicious of his motivations for immigrating to this foreign planet. As the Day of Magikarp was in the Reign of Lugia, Lugia had the final word, and being one of those opposed to Deoxys' inclusion as a legendary, Lugia refused to invite him. This angered Deoxys, and to take his revenge on Lugia and the legendaries, he decided to cripple the Pokémon of the day. Back then, Magikarp were strong Pokémon drawn to anger and hatred, but Deoxys, using his power over genes to alter their nature, made them weak and quelled their fighting spirits, in the hope that they would be driven to extinction and Lugia would be blamed for letting them perish.

But the Magikarp were more resilient than Deoxys had anticipated, and upon evolution into Gyarados their power returned redoubled. They survived Deoxys' plan, and though Lugia could not restore their former power, he sealed it so that they could not be weakened again. Livid at his failure, Deoxys retreated into himself and planned revenge against the legendaries, Lugia, and now also against the Magikarp that he had failed to wipe out.

Though he could not create new life on his own, he plotted to inspire humans to create a new legendary Pokémon. He tried his hand at first with the virtual Pokémon Porygon, which he innocently offered to Guard after the legendaries heard of it; then, confident in his skills, he planted the idea of the creation of Mewtwo in the minds of the humans.

At first, the newly-created Mewtwo did just as Deoxys had hoped, causing chaos among the legendaries and attempting to kill Mew and take his place. However, Mew met with Mewtwo and turned him over to the legendary Pokémon's side, and Mew had immediate suspicions about who was behind it. He went to Deoxys and told him: "You misguided fool; inspiring the creation of a new legendary Pokémon could have been the undoing of us all. If you swear that you will never do such a thing again, you may continue to inspire the humans to create lower Pokémon; but if you refuse, Mewtwo will become Guardian to the Pokémon that you have protected instead and you will be expelled from the ranks of the legendary Pokémon."

Deoxys grudgingly swore never to inspire the humans for the creation of a legendary Pokémon again, though he was permitted to inspire the creation of two new members of the Porygon family. Meanwhile, thanks to Mewtwo's newfound humility he found acceptance among the legendaries, reigning over a new Season of the Mind created in his honour.

From this day on the legendary Pokémon lived in peace and prosperity, but Deoxys still burned with jealousy and a deep-set grudge against the legendaries who had wronged him - and in secret, he was still planning his ultimate revenge.
