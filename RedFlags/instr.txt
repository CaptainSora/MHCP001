__Welcome to *Red Flags*!__

In this game, you will take turns designing the perfect date for one single individual.
You will make use of perks (white cards) to entice your single friend to pick your candidate, and use red flags (red cards) to sabotage another candidate. 

As a wingman/wingwoman, pick two perks (white cards) to make your candidate more attractive to your single friend.
After everyone picked their white cards, you will take turns sabotaging another candidate by picking a red flag (red card).
After everyone had sabotaged each other, the single person will choose the best candidate to go on a date with, and the person who designed that candidate gets 1 point.
The first player to earn 7 points is the winner.
