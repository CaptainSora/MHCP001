Core mechanic:
    Basic Combat:
        Time Unit-based Combat
        Each character has multiple moves available to them, which costs TU
        You can prepare a team to bring into combat (max. 4 members)
        Pick from a set number of moves
            E.g. Deal 200% of PWR
        Damage formula: Look at pokemon?

    Combat styles:
        Basic combat (see above)
        Survival (survive for certain time limit)
        Raid battles
            Each player fights boss on own time, damage to boss is cumulative
            Can be time-limited events
        Co-op battles
            Frontline and backline teams
            Only frontline teams can directly damage the boss/enemies
            Backline teams may be able to avoid damage
            Buffs/heals can be given to specific teams
            Backline can still debuff if it's not direct damage
    Status conditions???
        LIMIT TO ONLY A FEW THANKS
        Frozen increases physical damage taken (percentage of incoming damage)
        Bleeding increases magic damage taken (percentage of incoming damage)
        Chained decreases physical damage given (percentage of outgoing damage)
        Confused decreases magic damage given (percentage of outgoing damage)
        Poisoned prevents healing, some DOT? (10% of max HP per turn, lasts either TU or turns)
        Burned inflicts DOT (15% of max HP per turn, lasts either turns or TU)
        Enraged increases PWR and INT, lowers ARM and RES
        Petrified decreases AGI, ARM, RES
        Cursed
        Silenced
        Weakened
        Blinded decreases hit rate
        Slowed increases TU cost of any move (fixed or percentage?)
        Guarding takes damage in place of allies
        Defending reduces incoming damage
        Invisible makes user untargetable, lasts turns or until attacking move
        Doom has a chance to cause instant death after certain TU or turns
        Enemies can have resistances to certain status conditions
            i.e. probabilistically resisting status conditions

    Formation?
        Maybe 2x4 grid, you can place characters in spots which give buffs
        Each character can have a passive formation buff
            E.g. characters above get +10% atk, characters to left get +10% def, etc.

    Differing move speed per unit (tiles per day)
    Emergency rations which are heavy but allow
