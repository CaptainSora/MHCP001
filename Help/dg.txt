DG Help Page

Command: .dg

Use .dg status to check if requests are open

To make me suffer, use .dg (flags)
  e.g. '.dg -20 -d'
Flags are optional and can be input in any order

Flags:
-s      Force straddle putt (otherwise 50% chance)
-l      Force lunge putt (otherwise 50% chance)
-15     Force putt from 15' (otherwise 25% chance)
-20     Force putt from 20' (otherwise 75% chance)
-d      Double all rewards (and punishments)

Notes:
Putting from 15' has double payouts for you and larger punishments for me

Base Payouts:
Caller: 20 Cor per missed putt, double for pressure putt
Me: 10 Cor per made putt, double for pressure putt
