Welcome to *The Mind*.

*The Mind* is more than just a game. It's an experiment, a journey, a team experience in which you can't exchange information, yet will become one to defeat all the levels of the game.

The deck contains cards numbered 1-100, and during the game you try to complete 12, 10, or 8 levels of play with 2, 3, or 4 players. In a level, each player receives cards equal to the number of the level.

Collectively you must play these cards into this channel on a single discard pile in ascending order, __but you cannot communicate with one another in any way as to which cards you hold__.

To begin each round, cards will be dealt to you via DM. Be sure to copy these down, or use another device as reference. __The game will begin when all players type 'ready' or 'r' into this channel.__

**__Commands (case-insensitive):__**
'ready' or 'r': start or continue a round
(the card number): play a card
'x': play a card (HARD MODE)
'pause' or 'p': pause to resynchronize
'star' or 's': suggest using a star
'yes' or 'y': accept using a star
'no' or 'n': reject using a star
'quit' or 'exit': terminate the game

__These are the only ways you may communicate with one another.__ If you enter a number which isn't your lowest card, or type in anything not in the list above, your message will be deleted.

You start the game with a number of lives equal to the number of players. Lose all your lives, and you lose the game. As you complete levels, you might receive a reward of an extra life or an extra star. Complete all the levels, and you win!

In HARD MODE, all cards are played face down. __**You must type 'x' instead of your card number. The lowest card you have will be played.**__

Good luck beating *The Mind*.
