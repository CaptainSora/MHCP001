Welcome to *The Mind*.

*The Mind* is more than just a game. It's an experiment, a journey, a team experience in which you can't exchange information, yet will become one to defeat all the levels of the game.

In more detail, the deck contains cards numbered 1-100, and during the game you try to complete 12, 10, or 8 levels of play with 2, 3, or 4 players. In a level, each player receives a hand of cards equal to the number of the level: one card in level 1, two cards in level 2, etc.

Collectively you must play these cards into this channel on a single discard pile in ascending order, __but you cannot communicate with one another in any way as to which cards you hold__.

To begin each round, cards will be dealt to you via DM. Be sure to copy these down, or use another device as reference. __The game will begin when all players type 'ready' or 'r' into this channel.__ All game commands are case-insensitive, in case you are playing on mobile.

__**To play a card, type only the number into this channel.**__ You may also type 'pause' or 'p' at any point during the game to resynchronize all players. This will also show you the number of cards each player has. __These are the only ways you may communicate with one another.__ If you enter a number you don't have, or have already played, or type in anything else, your message will be deleted.

You start the game with a number of lives equal to the number of players. Lose all your lives, and you lose the game. As you complete levels, you might receive a reward of an extra life, if you're lucky. Complete all the levels, and you win!

At any time, you may enter 'quit' or 'exit' to end the game.

In HARD MODE, all cards are played face down. __**You must type 'x' instead of your card number. The lowest card you have will be played.**__

Good luck beating *The Mind*.
